1. Syn-Real-Train-Real-Val
	- single chair on simple background can be detected very well
	Problems: 
	- desks with 4 legs or sofas are also detected as chairs
	- a single chair can be bboxed several times, when the chair has either a complicated structure, or a cushion of different color on it
	- even classifies hanging lights as chairs(has something to do with flying chairs in the synthetic data?) 

2. Syn-Train-Real-val
	- performed extremely bad
	Problems:
	- bounding legs of chairs as chairs
	- not able to capture chairs he hasn't seen in the dataset
	- I think the model collapesed because there are many bboxes on the edge of the images with same confidence 0.424

3. Real-Train-Real-val
	Problems:
	- pretty much the same as syn-real-train-real-val, but without flying light issues
Hypothesis: it would work better if everything is on white background
